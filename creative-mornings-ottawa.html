        <p class="project-intro push-0 gray">The CM Ottawa team approached me to create a custom lettering piece that would be printed on merchandise to help raise funds for the event. Seeing as it is 100% free and the organizers give their time to plan awesome events every month, I was so happy and honoured to be able to help in any way that I could.</p>

It was meant to be printed on various products to help raise funds for the events, so it had to be versatile. I started by sketching a few different designs.</p>
