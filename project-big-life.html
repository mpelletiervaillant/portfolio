I had always been really interested in illustration, but was only creating small pieces for fun, so the chance to create illustrations from scratch and establish a look was super exciting to me but also so intimidating.</p>

I began with simple icons used in the questionnaires, like the genders and food drawings. The site was already using fun colours, and a bubbly background splash, so I decided to incorporate this style in the drawings.</p>

          <p class="milli serif">Once I had established these simple elements that I could pull colours and elements from, it was time to tackle the big stuff. Every calculator needed a sort of splash page, oh yeah, and one of them needs to be done by tomorrow because they are being interviewed on TV. Time to buckle down.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1 cs-content">
          <p class="milli serif push-2">Not going to lie, I was dreading drawing people. I found some reference images I liked I went from there. Still keeping the bubbly theme in mind, I drew characters and surprised myself for a first try. One of the main requirements was that the characters should look directly at the user; their eyes should stand out on the page. I developed these features that I thought were detailed enough to convey this idea. I finished the Heart & Stroke illustration on time, then the next day I receive this:</p>

          <p class="milli serif">Part of me is thinking: <strong class="base-sans">WOW THIS IS SO COOL</strong>, the other half is saying <strong class="base-sans">WHAT WAS I THINKING?</strong> It definitely needed some work, but for something made in a day I was pretty damn proud. I went on to develop the rest of the splash illustrations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1 cs-content">
          <p class="milli serif">One of the very first comments I got back was that they weren’t ‘cartoony’ enough. The PBL team had previously been using a cartoony style and they really wanted to incorporate this feeling into the new illustrations. Also, the faces did not scale well when very small. This needed to be fixed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1 cs-content">
          <p class="milli push-2 serif">Of course the right solution was to not restart the hours I had already invested in this. So I set off to fix what I had done. I researched styles I liked and set up a mood board. Then I tackled the most important part: the faces. I came up with a guide to keep consistency. These new designs are much better for this project: the eyes are bigger, the mouth and noses are simpler and more defined, and the shadows are kept to a minimum. I was really liking where this was going.</p>

        <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1 cs-content">
          <p class="milli push-2 serif">Next up: the bodies. Again, simplifying everything and making it cartoony was key. I rounded lines and exaggerated body part sizes. Here you can see the before and after.</p>

        <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1 cs-content">
          <p class="milli push-2 serif">I was feeling way better about the after. Now it was a question of converting all the old illustrations into the new style, which was done pretty quickly since the bulk of the work was already complete. </p>
